# lesson 02 : variables
myVariable = "my value"

#Rules
#we can not use dash -
#we can not put numbers in the beginning
#Case sensitive (Name is not  name)

name = "Hicham Berr" #single word => normal
myName = "Hicham Berr" # two words => camelCase
my_name = "Hicham Berr" #two words snake_case

print(myName)
print(my_name)
print(name)

#you can use the same variable more than one time for different data type

x = 10
x = "Hello"

print(x)

# reserved keyword , words that we can not use like variables
help("keywords")

#list
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a,b,c)
